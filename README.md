AsmPro is an Assembler IDE for the Amiga. It is an fork of AsmOne based on updating a disassembled version of AsmOne. One of it's strong points where the fact that it was the first fork/clone of AsmOne to support graphics cards and syntax coloring. With Asm-Pro V1.16f (04-03-2000) the project had been made opensource. However the original developer of AsmPro stopped working on AsmPro in Q1 2001, after which development slowed down to almost a halt.
